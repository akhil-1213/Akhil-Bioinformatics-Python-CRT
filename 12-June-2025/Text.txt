Set is created using set()
Set is unordered i.e., elements in the set are randomly shuffled and do not have a indexes
Operations on set:
-> add() - adds value to set
-> update() - adds a set to another Set
-> remove() - removes value from the Set
-> discard() - removes value from the set but doesn't raise error if value not present
-> clear() - deletes an entire set
-> union() - '|' - gives unique elements out of two given sets
-> intersection() - '&' - gives common elements out of two given sets
-> Differenece() - '-' - gives elements that are unique in first set but not in second set
-> Symmetric Differenece() - '^' - gives unique elements from either set but not both

**Methods**
-> .union()
-> .Differenece()
-> .intersection()
-> .issubset()
-> .issuperset()
